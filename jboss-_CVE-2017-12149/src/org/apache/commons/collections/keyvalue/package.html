<BODY>
<p>
This package contains implementations of collection and map related key/value classes.
These are usually used in maps, however they can be used as data holders in any collection.
<p>
The following key/value designs are included:
<ul>
<li>Map Entry - various map entry implementations
<li>KeyValue - a key and value pair, without map entry semantics
<li>MultiKey - a holder of multiple keys tied together
</ul>
</pre>
